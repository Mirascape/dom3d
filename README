dom3d: 3d with HTML/CSS

This code is still very much experimental. The API will certainly change quickly.

Runs in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.

dom3d.js is where the API is exposed and interfaces between the use and the renderer.
renderer.js is where the base renderer is defined.
renderer_css.js is the CSS renderer.
renderer_raphael.js is the Raphael/SVG renderer.
dump-vertices.scm is a Scheme script to parse a .obj model into a javascript mesh that dom3d can load.
