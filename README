dom3d: 3d with pure HTML/CSS

This code is still very much experimental. The API will certainly change quickly.

dom3d.js is where the API is exposed and interfaces between the use and the renderer.
renderer.js is where the base renderer is defined.
renderer_css.js is the CSS renderer.
renderer_raphael.js is the Raphael/SVG renderer.
